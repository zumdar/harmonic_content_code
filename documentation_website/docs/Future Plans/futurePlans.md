# Future Plans

This installation is planned on being built in Fall 2021 as a capstone design project for a degree in Electrical Engineering. 

## Things to do for Summer and Fall 2021
There are many things left to be built and figured out with regards to the entire installation. The idea is to learn how to build a system like this from the ground up. The analog sound creation circuitry will play an integral part of the technical side of the installation. 

- Build 6 voltage controlled oscillators, voltage controlled filters, and voltage controlled amplifiers. 
- create a PCB that ties all analog circuitry together with the microcontroller, DAC, and external controls
- external controls 
	- MIDI to control voltage 
		- there are commercial available modules that do this, so we will probably purchase one 
	- create a patchbay to send in control voltages for pitch, timbre shape, amplifier, etc.

- Create the sculpture out of acrylic, wood, and metal
- program the microcontroller to handle quantizing pitches, handling sequencing, finish the autotuning algorithm
